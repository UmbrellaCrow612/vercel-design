# Vercel Design 

This is a design system made by the people over at vercel.

It is has great UI and UX.

The offical `components` they use are here https://vercel.com/design/introduction however these are not open source.

The `Icons` they use however are open source and can be found here https://vercel.com/design/icons.

The color template they use is open source and can be found here https://vercel.com/design/color as well as the css file i have attached which has them set as css variables.


# Alternative component libary to consider 

Shad cn ui component libary is really good and has a similar ui and ux feel to vercel, these are great as they allow you to fully moify them to your liking so you could use both shadcn ui and vercel colors in conjuction.
